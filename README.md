# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction-Competition-2015
In recent years, the malware industry has become a well organized market involving large amounts of money. Well funded, multi-player syndicates invest heavily in technologies and capabilities built to evade traditional protection, requiring anti-malware vendors to develop counter mechanisms for finding and deactivating them. In the meantime, they inflict real financial and emotional pain to users of computer systems.One of the major challenges that anti-malware faces today is the vast amounts of data and files which need to be evaluated for potential malicious intent. For example, Microsoft's real-time detection anti-malware products are present on over 160M computers worldwide and inspect over 700M computers monthly. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential malware. One of the main reasons for these high volumes of different files is the fact that, in order to evade detection, malware authors introduce polymorphism to the malicious components. This means that malicious files belonging to the same malware "family", with the same forms of malicious behavior, are constantly modified and/or obfuscated using various tactics, such that they look like many different files.

In order to be effective in analyzing and classifying such large amounts of files, we need to be able to group them into groups and identify their respective families. In addition, such grouping criteria may be applied to new files encountered on computers in order to detect them as malicious and of a certain family.

For this challenge, Microsoft is providing the data science community with an unprecedented malware dataset and encouraging open-source progress on effective techniques for grouping variants of malware files into their respective families.
<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
<p>
    In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to <b>identify whether a given piece of file/software<b> is a malware.

<h3> Data Overview</h3>
<li> Source : https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data </li>
<li> For every malware, we have two files <ol> <li> .asm file (read more: https://www.reviversoft.com/file-extensions/asm) </li><li>.bytes file (the raw data contains the hexadecimal representation of the file's binary content, without the PE header)</li></ol></li> 
    
<li>Total train dataset consist of 200GB data out of which 50Gb of data is .bytes files and 150GB of data is .asm files:  </li>
